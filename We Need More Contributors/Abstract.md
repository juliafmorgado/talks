## Title
We Need More Contributors: My OSS Story

## Abstract
Community shapes the software industry. Despite this understanding, open source communities continue to struggle to break down barriers and become more accessible to a more diverse pool of contributors, maintainers, and leaders.
The goal of this talk is to explore the challenges that remain and what I have learned and heard directly from the open source community to make sure the DevOps community fosters diversity and enables global collaboration.
