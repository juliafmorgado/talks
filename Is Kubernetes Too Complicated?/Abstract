## Title
Is Kubernetes Too Complicated?

## Abstract
Kubernetes is slowly seeming like that buzzword that gets thrown around, with many not knowing what the open-source container orchestration platform does. There are components, APIs, nodes, pods, containers, deployments, services, and much more â€” is it really necessary to understand them all to get started? What could be the best learning strategy for a beginner in cloud-native?

Join this talk to learn the history and concepts of Kubernetes and figure out how to use it properly and efficiently. You will hear stories of my learning journey, challenges I faced, followed by a quick demo where you'll start understanding the value that Kubernetes brings to the table. As Kubernetes becomes easier to use, we will see a thriving ecosystem emerge.

## CTA
Let's keep working hard to bring Kubernetes to a larger and larger set of users and environments.

## Learning Goal
The goal is to grow our community. We need to find ways to reach more users and more environments. The easier Kubernetes is to use the more we will see a thriving ecosystem based on top of it.
