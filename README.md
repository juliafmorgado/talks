Julia's Talks
===================

Hi.

I talk sometimes.

And the content of these talks are here.

Or at least they will be, when I put everything up.

Check out my [speaker rider](./speaker-rider.md) if you'd like me to speak at your event!

*NOTE:* Talks are in markdown, but they might look funky.  That's because I run them in [Deckset](http://decksetapp.com/).
