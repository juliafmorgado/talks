# Speaker Rider

I love speaking at events, and am so grateful to organizers who ask me to participate! I feel so privileged to be considered, and want to use that privilege to help the tech community be as inclusive as possible, where everyone can feel represented.

Anyway, onwards:

## In-Person Events

### 🛩️/🚋 **Travel expenses covered**
- Airfare and local transportation to the conference (unless lodging is within walking distance)

### 🏨 **Lodging expenses covered**
- I ask that lodging is provided for the full length of the event, unless the event is local!
- For events outside of the US, I ask for at least one full day of lodging before the event since I'll likely be flying in a day or two before.
- Same blurb as above, if I'm booking my own lodging!

### 🎙 Logistics
- Wireless microphone option (handheld or lavalier)
- Microphone for audience members if you plan to do Q&A
- Confidence monitor visible by the speaker, as a "second monitor" for my slides and speaker notes. Depending on the venue, this can often be my laptop screen.

## Virtual events
- I personally prefer live talks rather than pre-recording videos. Pre-recording involves a lot of editing time because of the nature of the medium. If you highly prefer pre-recording, please consider the time commitment with speaker honorariums, or have an editor on your team who can do those edits.
- During talks, please include some sort of moderation of comments (preferably before they go live for the audience to see). Internet trolls unfortunately exist, and have ruined talk playbacks in the past.
- For live virtual events, please make sure that you have a clear plan and run of show for any issues with internet instability.

### 🎙 Logistics
- Code of Conduct is still a requirement, and I expect moderators and staff from the conference in all places where attendees can gather (chat, etc.)
- The event platform should be accessible to WCAG AA standards.

## **Speaker honorarium**
- I ask for a speaker fee because I value my time (and hope you do too), I often have to take time off of work or projects to travel and attend, and because I want to normalize people getting paid for their work (especially underrepresented groups).
- For non-profit events, I may choose to waive this based on ticket pricing, scholarship programs, etc.
- I'm not putting a number here because it varies depending on the event. Please don't make it awkward and be like "uh, we don't normally pay speakers, but you get exposure," because I can't pay my bills with exposure. <3 I understand that some events don't have budget to pay speakers, and I'll address this on a case-by-case basis (but also, you should have budget to pay your speakers).

### 🎟 **Ticket to full conference**
- I ask for a ticket to the full conference as a speaker. I love participating in conferences, engaging with other attendees, and attending talks!

## Event logistics

### 📝 **Code of Conduct (CoC)**
- Long story short, you gotta have one of these. And please don't make it be something like "don't be a jerk," and that's it! Unfortunately I've been a person who has had to use a Code of Conduct with a very underprepared organizing team, and I would hate for any others to have that sort of experience.
- Here's a couple great CoC examples: [JSConfEu](https://2019.jsconf.eu/code-of-conduct/) and [Rust Community](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)

### 🔺 **Physically accessible space for all areas used** 
- All areas that are part of the conference should be accessible. Period.
- Accessibility of space should follow the criteria of the American Disabilities Act** and/or equivalent local standards.

### 👩 **Representation**
- No all-white panels
- I feel like this is obvious, but I shouldn't be the token female at an event.

### 📀 **Intellectual Property**
- I'm cool with being recorded, just let me know ahead of time.
- I guarantee that everything I do is rated "PG" with no swearing or inappropriate/explicit remarks.
- I typically use [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/) if I am using slides. I regularly post my slides here in this repo, if the talk isn't majority live-coding. I can provide a generated PDF of my slides or Markdown.

## Bonus points I would love to see

- Live captioning is incredibly beneficial to those who are hard of hearing, struggle with focus, or prefer to process written information.
- Gender pronoun identification provided by some method for attendees to self-identify if they so choose is awesome.
- A scholarship program for those who can't otherwise afford to attend is huge! Also, to note, be careful about your wording of the scholarship program. I've seen some rough ones where the conferences strongly imply that "diverse candidates need charity," which is not a good stereotype to push out there.
- The ability to use my own computer/setup is preferred. I've been to some events where they require me to use their machines, which works if I'm just using slides, but I often live-code in my talks and unfamiliar keyboard layouts can lead to a less fluid presentation. This is also important for those who need to use assistive technologies on a given machine!


## Final thoughts
Thank you so much for reading through all of this! I hope none of it is particularly surprising, and that it's reasonable for you. I want to speak at events that are inclusive, diverse, and accessible to everyone, and hope to contribute to the community surrounding them. If you disagree with parts of this, or want to discuss terms more, I am all ears and would love to speak further.

If you are interested in having me speak, please provide the following:
- Confirmation you have read this speaker rider with questions/any criteria you are unable to meet
- Conference name, website, date of events, location
- Budget for speaker honorarium
- Tentative/confirmed speaker list
- What you are interested in having me speak about
