# Speaker Rider

I love speaking at events, and am so grateful to organizers who ask me to participate! I feel so privileged to be considered, and want to use that privilege to help the tech community be as inclusive as possible, where everyone can feel represented.

Anyway, onwards:

## In-Person Events

## **Speaker honorarium**
- I ask for a speaker fee because I value my time (and hope you do too), I often have to take time off of work or projects to travel and attend, and because I want to normalize people getting paid for their work (especially underrepresented groups).
- For non-profit events, I may choose to waive this based on ticket pricing, scholarship programs, etc.
- I'm not putting a number here because it varies depending on the event. Please don't make it awkward and be like "uh, we don't normally pay speakers, but you get exposure," because I can't pay my bills with exposure. <3 I understand that some events don't have budget to pay speakers, and I'll address this on a case-by-case basis (but also, you should have budget to pay your speakers).

### 📝 **Code of Conduct (CoC)**
- Long story short, you gotta have one of these. And please don't make it be something like "don't be a jerk," and that's it!
- Here's a couple great CoC examples: [JSConfEu](https://2019.jsconf.eu/code-of-conduct/) and [Rust Community](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)

### 🛩️/🚋 **Travel expenses covered**
- Reimbursement for Airfare and local transportation to the conference (unless lodging is within walking distance).

### 🏨 **Lodging expenses covered**
- I prefer to book my own accommodation (unless, in the case of accommodation, you have arrangements in place with the venue or nearby hotel).
- I ask for at least one full day of lodging before the event, as I cannot travel to and from the event in one day and still be expected to present at the best of my ability.
- I cannot do so out-of-pocket, so I require the funds upfront. An Invoice and receipts can be provided upon request.

### 🎟 **Complimentary Ticket**
- I ask for a ticket to the full conference as a speaker. I love participating in conferences, engaging with other attendees, and attending talks! I might even do a vlog of the conference :)

### 🎙 Logistics
- I prefer a working wireless and ideally hands-free microphone.
- My preference is to bring my own laptop with a prepared slide deck.
- If possible, I would like advance access to the room where the talk is to be given to test out any slides and audio. This does not need to be directly before the talk, but can be the day before or the morning of.
- I'm cool with being recorded, just let me know ahead of time.

### ⏳ Deadlines
- I expect to receive any information required to give my talk (which room, exact time to be present before/after the agreed upon talk time, other necessary information such as login data, upload folders, tech requirements to give my talk, presentation formats, mandatory slide templates, etc) at least four weeks before my talk is taking place.

### 🔺 **Physically accessible space for all areas used** 
- All areas that are part of the conference should be accessible. Period.

### 👩 **Representation**
- No all-white panels
- I feel like this is obvious, but I shouldn't be the token female at an event.

## Virtual events
- I personally prefer live talks rather than pre-recording videos. If you highly prefer pre-recording, please an editor on your team who can do the edits.
- For live virtual events, please make sure that you have a clear plan and run of show for any issues with internet instability.

## Final thoughts
Thank you so much for reading through all of this! I hope none of it is particularly surprising, and that it's reasonable for you. I want to speak at events that are inclusive, diverse, and accessible to everyone, and hope to contribute to the community surrounding them. If you disagree with parts of this, or want to discuss terms more, I am all ears and would love to speak further.

If you are interested in having me speak, please provide the following:
- Confirmation you have read this speaker rider with questions/any criteria you are unable to meet
- Conference name, website, date of events, location
- Budget for speaker honorarium
- Tentative/confirmed speaker list
- What you are interested in having me speak about and the duration of the talk
